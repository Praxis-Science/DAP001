2025-03-19T02:57:26.912Z,3011236924,"I am a computer scientist with 40+ years experience in artificial intelligence. While working at Carnegie Mellon University for 28 years, I led academic research projects as well as developed products for industrial and government customers. Upon leaving CMU, I founded LindenAI, LLC, a management consulting company to help academia, defense, government, industry, and policy makers in applying AI, robotics, and advanced automation to their problems.","One of the US's competitive advantages is the pipeline in which basic scientific research is matured into technologies that, in turn, develop new economies. That process is sometimes haphazard and subject to the capabilities of the leaders of that lead that transformation. I have observed gaps in the ways in which science - to - technology maturation programs are structured, and would like to develop an engineering discipline for improving the process and making the improved process repeatable and with a high rate of success. My area of expertise is in computer science and technologies that are based on digital representations of knowledge.",Access to policy makers at all levels of government.

2025-03-24T17:55:27.836Z,3011236927,"I'm a founder for an AI consultancy and R&D lab called Intuition Labs. My background is in STEM With a chemical engineering (biomedical focus) degree, electrochemistry, materials, healthcare technology (EHRs/EMRs), strategy consulting, operational consulting, data science, and most recently AI R&D and agent systems engineering","Literacy rates are continuing to plummet while we make strides in language modeling and verbalized reasoning. Humans are losing capabilities while machines are gaining them.

I also think there's way too much shoe horning and myopic tunnel vision in the science community. Too many lifelong researchers learned about a niche but forgot about how to intuitively apply it to many learnings/observations day to day. 

For example, I'm still perplexed that we question why we aren't using information systems research more readily in the quest for understanding physics/quantum phenomena/high dimensional maths, given information prediciton and even next token prediction translates supremely well to next action prediction. 

Money and the rise of corporate cronies has also infiltrated R&D, polishing turds into chocolate bars with nice packaging. We need to decentralize science research and advance it in a more rigorous way.

Finally, the rise of sociopathy and psychopathy across ""elites"" in every major area of science, from the academics of it, to the applications and engineering of it. From Tesla and Theranos to all the publications pumping out 1000s of fake AI papers, we're riddled with people who are unfortunately intelligent but not self aware/conscious enough to understand the end of the road for these ways. WE need to stop this ASAP.","Technical polymaths and intuitive thinkers who are willing to challenge the status quo and not throw out wild or contrarian ideas that have merit. For example, if I say I have a potential solution to the Riemann hypothesis or have figured out a theory of everything, I want a community that intuitively would be able to start thinking about which one of the paths that they too have considered may my theory be building upon, because they have also thought something this ""crazy' in the past but haven't had the chance to express the idea for fear of mockery."
